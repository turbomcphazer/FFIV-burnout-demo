Recreating the enemy burnout effect from Final Fantasy IV (SNES)

I always liked the enemy-burnout effect from the original SNES Final Fantasy IV (or II, if you like). 
Decided to recreate it as a Unity sprite shader and it turned out to be surprisingly complex. I knew 
it started with the sprite's palette turning purple and then fading to black while lines were removed, 
but I thought the line removal was just random, one line at a time. Actually, what gives the effect a 
lot of its charm is that the lines are almost more of a dither pattern, in continuous motion. Bit 
trickier to implement, but here's my attempt.
